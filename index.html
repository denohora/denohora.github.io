<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>I'm an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology">experimental psychologist</a> 
	in the <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/psychology/index.html">School of Psychology</a> at 
	the <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie">National University of Ireland in Galway</a>.</p>
			
<p>In our lab, we investigate the dynamics of Learning and Applied Cognition.  
	Our research uses fine-grained behavioral analyses to assess how the interaction between person 
	and environment changes over time.</p>
