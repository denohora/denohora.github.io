## Welcome!
I'm an [experimental psychologist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology)
and behavioural scientist and I am particularly interested in consumer behaviour.

In our lab, we investigate the dynamics of Learning and Decision Making. 
	Our research uses fine-grained behavioural analyses to investigate learning and decision making 
	processes in minute detail. For example, we track how people move a mouse cursor when making simple 
	decisions to understand how the information they are considering changes during their decision. Also, 
	we track eye movement to understand how people sample information and update their decisions.
